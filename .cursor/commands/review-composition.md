# Review Component Composition

Apply the Vercel Composition Patterns skill. Review the selected/current component for:

- Boolean prop proliferation (many `isX`, `showY`, `hasZ` props)
- Opportunities for compound components
- State lifting to reduce prop drilling
- Internal composition for flexibility

Reference: `.agents/skills/vercel-composition-patterns/AGENTS.md`

Suggest refactors using compound components, state lifting, or composition patterns.
