# Optimize React/Next.js Performance

Focus on CRITICAL and HIGH impact optimizations from Vercel React Best Practices:

1. **Eliminate waterfalls** – Use Promise.all(), parallel fetching, Suspense boundaries
2. **Reduce bundle size** – Direct imports, dynamic imports for heavy components
3. **Server-side** – Auth in server actions, React.cache(), minimize RSC serialization
