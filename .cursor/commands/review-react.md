# Review React/Next.js for Performance

Apply the Vercel React Best Practices skill. Review the selected/current code for:

- **Waterfalls**: Sequential awaits, API route chains, missing parallelization
- **Bundle size**: Barrel imports, heavy components without dynamic import
- **Server-side**: Auth in server actions, React.cache(), RSC serialization
- **Re-renders**: Unnecessary useMemo, effect dependencies, derived state patterns

Provide specific fixes with before/after code examples.
