# Review UI for Web Best Practices

Apply the Web Design Guidelines skill. Review the selected/current UI code for:

- Accessibility (aria-labels, semantic HTML, keyboard handlers)
- Focus states and forms (autocomplete, validation, error handling)
- Images (dimensions, lazy loading, alt text)
- Animation (prefers-reduced-motion, compositor-friendly transforms)
- Typography, dark mode, touch/interaction

Output findings in terse `file:line` format with specific remediation steps.
